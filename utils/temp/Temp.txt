### Example 1 — Clear Text Response

The Mainframe RACF onboarding process contains five steps:

1. Request creation in ServiceNow using the Mainframe RACF access form.
2. Verification of requestor identity and entitlement by GIAM Operations.
3. RACF administrator validation for UID format, region, and security domain.
4. Creation of user profile in target LPAR according to standardized naming.
5. Notification to requestor and evidence attachment in ServiceNow.

Make sure all approvals are visible and stored as artifacts before proceeding.

### Example 2 — Step-by-step Actionable Procedure

To generate RACF user activity logs:

Step 1: Access the RACF admin panel using elevated credentials.
Step 2: Navigate to "Activity → User Log Tracking".
Step 3: Select the LPAR group (HK01, HK02, CT2).
Step 4: Choose the reporting period (daily, weekly, monthly).
Step 5: Export the log set to the secure masterfile directory.
Step 6: Validate log completeness using checksum review.

### Example 3 — Policies Explained Clearly
