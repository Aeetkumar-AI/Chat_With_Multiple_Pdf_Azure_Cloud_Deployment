	•	Built dual vector indexes (standard + agentic chunks) to capture different semantic granularities.
	•	Applied hybrid retrieval (dense + MMR reranking) to surface the most relevant policy context.
	•	Improved answer accuracy, reduced hallucination, and ensured policy-compliant responses for GCM/PCM queries.
