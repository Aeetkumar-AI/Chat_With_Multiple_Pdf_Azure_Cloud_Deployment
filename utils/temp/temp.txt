*CALCULATION METHODOLOGY:*
Final Severity Score = MIN(10, Base Score + Sum of All Applicable Multipliers)

*Severity Label Mapping:*
- 1-3: Low
- 4-5: Medium
- 6-7: High
- 8-10: Critical

*Recommendation Mapping:*
- 1-3: Auto-Approve (with standard controls)
- 4-5: Needs Review (business approval)
- 6-7: Needs Review (security + business approval)
- 8-10: Needs Review (CISO approval required)

*ANALYSIS PROCESS:*
1. Identify base risk category and assign base score
2. Identify all applicable multipliers from the story context
3. Calculate: Base Score + Sum of Multipliers (capped at 10)
4. Map final score to severity label and recommendation
5. Document reasoning showing base score + multipliers used

*Story to Analyze:*
Summary: {summary}
Description: {description}
Acceptance Criteria: {acceptance_criteria}
Domain: {domain}

*CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:*
- You must respond with ACTUAL VALUES, not field names
- Show your calculation: "Base Score X + Multiplier Y + Multiplier Z = Final Score"
- Identify specific multipliers that apply based on story content
- Use exact values from the framework above

*Required Response Format (use actual values):*
{{
  "change_type": "Major",
  "severity_score": 7,
  "severity_label": "High", 
  "recommendation": "Needs Review",
  "subcategory_identified": "SSL certificate creation",
  "risk_factors_identified": ["Certificate management", "Production system", "Customer-facing"],
  "reasoning": "Base Score: 6 (SSL certificate changes, single domain) + SOX Supporting Systems: +2 + Production Internal: +1 = 9 (Critical). SSL certificate creation in SOX production environment requires CISO approval due to potential compliance and security impact."
}}

*Important*: Always show your calculation in the reasoning field and use specific multipliers identified from the story content.
