vvv🔐 IS Impact Evaluation Rulebook

🚫 Absolute Prohibition (Never Flag as IS Impact)

Stories that must always be excluded:
	•	✘ Bug fixes, defect fixes, error handling, validations without IS impact.
	•	✘ Backend-only updates (table creation, view creation, ETL scripts, data marts) with no security relevance.
	•	✘ Dashboard/reporting/analysis work (Tableau, QC Dashboard, PEQR Dashboard, etc.).
	•	✘ CR creation, UAT/DEV/PROD support tasks, release activities.
	•	✘ Enhancements unrelated to security (UI changes, graphs, simple analytics).
	•	✘ Ad-hoc support/monitoring requests with no IS domain alignment.

⸻

✅ Mandatory Actions (Always Do This)
	•	ALWAYS apply exclusion criteria before marking IS Impact.
	•	ALWAYS evaluate the full context (Summary + Description + Acceptance Criteria).
	•	ALWAYS maintain consistency across similar story structures.
	•	ALWAYS map flagged stories to one of the six IS Domains (Auth, Data Security, AppSec, AdminSec, NetworkSec, Vulnerability).
	•	ALWAYS assume domain-specific terms and acronyms are correct (don’t question them).

⚖️ Before Finalizing Score & Decision

Double-check your evaluation:
	•	✔ Does the story directly touch security controls, processes, or data?
	•	✔ Does it clearly belong to one IS domain?
	•	✔ Could the change affect confidentiality, integrity, or availability?
	•	✔ Am I being consistent with how I judged similar stories earlier?
	•	✔ Have I applied all exclusion rules?
	•	✔ Would another reviewer, given the same story, reach the same IS Impact decision?
